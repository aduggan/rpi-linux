config RMI4_CORE
	tristate "Synaptics RMI4 bus support"
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to support the Synaptics RMI4 bus.  This is
	  required for all RMI4 device support.

	  If unsure, say Y.

	  This feature is not currently available as a loadable module.

config RMI4_DEBUG
	bool "RMI4 Debugging"
	depends on RMI4_CORE
	select DEBUG_FS
	help
	  Say Y here to enable debug feature in the RMI4 driver.

	  Note that the RMI4 driver debug features can generate a lot of
	  output (potentially clogging up your dmesg output) and generally
	  slow down driver operation.  It's recommended to enable them only
	  if you are actively developing/debugging RMI4 features.

	  If unsure, say N.

config RMI4_I2C
	tristate "RMI4 I2C Support"
	depends on RMI4_CORE && I2C
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to support RMI4 devices connected to an I2C
	  bus.

	  If unsure, say Y.

	  This feature is not currently available as a loadable module.
